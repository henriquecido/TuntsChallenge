# TuntsChallenge

## About

The challenge is based on performing some operations with the data I get from the spreadsheet, such as: student average, their current situation and their grade to pass the final exam.

I get the sheet information through the Google Sheets API.

To run the program you may just need to create a Google Sheets API in your account and create your credential to add it to your application.

The step-by-step procedures are at this link: https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/dotnet

Note: If you already have the credentials and API created in your Google account, just change the information in the file 'credentials.json' within the project.

After following the above procedures, just run the program and follow the changes in the following spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SKQHuBH1T49my-JT_wNoLcEtZUKSp4vM_GjXvNtz1JI/edit#gid=0
